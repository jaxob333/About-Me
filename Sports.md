#Sports

I am an avid fan of sports. Sports is a big part of my life. My favorite sports are football,soccer and basketball. 
I do watch a little of baseball but I am not much of a fan.
My favorite basketball team is the _Philadelphia 76ers_. 
More specifically my favorite player is **Joel Embiid**. 
I also am a big fan of the Memphis Grizzlies.
In the NFL I am a huge fan of the _Green Bay Packers_. In my opinion **Aaron Rodgers** is the G.O.A.T. Also I must add that all Bears fans should give up
on this season. My favorite MLS soccer team is probably the Nashville SC and my favorite international team is probably Manchester United or Chelsea. 
I do watch some baseball but not a lot. My favorite team has to be the St. Louis Cardinals. I also must add that the reason I am into sports is because
of the life lessons it teaches. Sports teach cooperation, heart and helps create a work ethic in people. What I mean by heart is the willpower to never
give up when things seem rough and tough. 


(P.S): Enjoy a mini slide show of my favorite players.
