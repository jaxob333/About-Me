# Hobbies

One of my favorite hobbies is to watch **ANIME**. Anime is something that I enjoy and think that teaches important lessons. I have learned to never give up and to push on thanks to anime. My favorite anime of all time has to be That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime. Before watching this show my opinoin of slimes were trash. I thought they were bottom feeders that noobs would destroy to quickly level up to level 2. But after this show slimes skyrocketed in my eyes. Now I think that all slimes are overpowered beings that must be kept alive at all costs. But enough about anime.

I also enjoy working out sometimes. I feel like working out is good place to connect with my inner self because when your lifting weights its you and only you that can lift the weights. 

I have a few more hobbies but I do not want to take up anymore of your time so I will start my conclusion. 

# Brief Conclusion

I am a sophomore at the University of Missouri that is an IT Major that enjoys anime and other mundane activites that a normal person would enjoy.

Thank you for your time:)
