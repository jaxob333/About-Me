# Coding

So far I have taken quite of bit of coding classes in college. Before I came to college I had no experience in coding. So learning how to code on campus is still kind of hard to this day but its not that hard to learn. But I have a huger disadvantage compared to my peers because they have coded some before they came to college. 

Here are a list of some languages I have dabbled in since taking classes at Mizzou. 

1) C
2) Python
3) HTML
4) JavaScript
5) C#

Out of these five languages I am most comfortable with C# and Python. HTML and JavaScript are pretty decent with me but I am so terrible at C and can barely code anything in C. 


Also here is a little demo code in JavaScript:

``` javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>This is a random decimal number generator. Pretty cool right!</h2>


<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = Math.random();
</script>

</body>
</html>
```
